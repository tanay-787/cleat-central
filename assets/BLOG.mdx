# CleatCentral ‚Äì Building a Football-Focused E-Commerce Experience

When I built **CleatCentral** as my capstone project for the Full-Stack Development Bootcamp, I didn‚Äôt want it to be *just another e-commerce clone*. I wanted to craft something that felt modern, polished, and actually solved a niche problem ‚Äî helping football players find the right boots.

## Why CleatCentral?

Buying football cleats online can be tricky. You don‚Äôt just pick a size and brand ‚Äî you need to think about playing surface, boot height, and style. Most e-commerce sites don‚Äôt make this decision-making process easy. That‚Äôs where CleatCentral steps in: a **football-focused shopping platform** that not only sells cleats but also educates players about the right choice for their game.

## What Makes CleatCentral Unique?

Beyond the standard shopping features, I added some UI touches to elevate the user experience:

- üé† **Product Carousel** ‚Äì On product detail pages, users can browse through multiple product views in a clean, interactive carousel.
- üé® **Dynamic Theme-Aware Branding** ‚Äì Both the **logo and favicon automatically adapt** to light or dark theme preferences. The system even detects OS theme settings for a personalized experience.
- ‚öΩ **‚ÄúKnow Your Boots‚Äù Section** ‚Äì A one-of-a-kind guide that breaks down boot types (Firm Ground, Turf, Indoor, etc.) and styles (High-Top vs. Low-Top). This feature transforms CleatCentral from a store into a *trusted advisor*.

*The ‚ÄúKnow Your Boots‚Äù section helping users make informed purchases.*

## Core Features

- **Authentication & Profiles** ‚Äì Secure signup/login with JWT in HttpOnly cookies and personalized profiles.
- **Product Catalog** ‚Äì Filter cleats by surface type, boot style, or brand.
- **Cart System** ‚Äì Add, update, or remove items seamlessly.
- **Modern UI** ‚Äì Built with Tailwind CSS + ShadCN UI, with responsive layouts and dark mode support.

## How I Built It

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, React Router, Context API.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT auth.
- **Deployment**: Full-stack app deployed on **Vercel**, with the backend serving both API and static frontend.

## Lessons Learned

- The importance of **balancing scope vs. polish** (I focused on a clean, working experience first because of the time-constraints and planned order history/payment features for later).
- Implementing **theme-aware assets** to make branding feel more ‚Äúalive.‚Äù
- The whole process of developing and deploying a full-stack application on the cloud.
